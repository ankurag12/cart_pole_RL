Problem description here: https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0

The goal is to balance the pole on the cart using Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Why use RL when it can be solved using simple PID control? Because we can.

Still Work-in-progress. Average reward does not meet the problem's "solving criterion".
